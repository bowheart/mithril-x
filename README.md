# Sheath

Sheath is a utility library for modular applications. It's *the* module library.

Check out Sheath's coolness list:

- A clean, overly simplistic interface for creating modules.
- Dependency injection.
- Asynchronous script loading.
- Utilities for easily creating common types of modules.
- Designed to improve the flow of frameworks such as Backbone, React, Inferno, and Mithril.
- Awesome debugging tools, including opt-in circular dependency detection.
- Even awesomer dependency graph analysis tools available server-side for easy automation.
- Highly optimized code. Most of Sheath's algorithms are simple lookups &ndash; O(1) time.

## A simple example

> Note: All examples will use es6 syntax. You've been warned.

Let's create a module.

```javascript
sheath('dagger', () => 'a dagger')
```

Simple as that. Let's break down what happened here:

- We *declared* a module named 'dagger'.
- Sheath called our arrow function. This function is our module's *factory*. The factory *defined* our module.
- We exposed the string `'a dagger'` as our module's *default export*. Our module's exports are what will get injected into dependents.

Alright. Cool, I guess. Now what was the point of that?

Let's create another module:

```javascript
sheath('assassin', ['dagger'], dagger =>
    'A deadly assassin. Weapon: ' + dagger
)
```

Let's break this one down:

- We declared a module named 'assassin' with one dependency, 'dagger'.
- Sheath ensured that the dagger module was loaded before:
- Sheath called the assassin module's factory, passing ("injecting") the dagger module's default export as the first argument. This defined the assassin module.
- We exposed a new string as the default export of the assassin module.

Every module goes through this basic life cycle.
